Remove unwanted blocks from the Gutenberg Block Inserter.

== Description ==

The Gutenberg Block inserter can quickly become cluttered. There are currently over 200 free blocks available, in addition to the 34 core blocks. This plugin allows you to disable the blocks you or your clients don't need.

## TODO

* Add search function to the block list.
* Add 'enabled/disabled' filter to block list.
* Add 'Block Author' filter to block list.

## Missing Blocks

If you find a block you can't disable using this plugin, please create a [support thread](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/disable-gutenberg-blocks).
